        # Switch to Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode
        # WHAT: This changes SQLite's journaling mode to WAL, which separates reads and writes into two files.
        #       This allows concurrent reads while writes are being performed in the WAL file.
        # WHY: WAL mode is ideal for high-concurrency scenarios (like FastAPI) because it improves read performance
        #      and allows multiple readers while a single writer is active.
        await self.connection.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;")

        # Set synchronous mode to NORMAL
        # WHAT: The "synchronous" PRAGMA determines how aggressively SQLite ensures that data is written to disk.
        #       "NORMAL" means SQLite syncs writes less often than "FULL" mode, which reduces disk I/O.
        # WHY: NORMAL mode is a trade-off between durability and performance, suitable for most web applications.
        #      It ensures fast writes while maintaining reasonable safety for data (you might lose the last few
        #      transactions during a crash but the database remains intact).
        await self.connection.execute("PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;")

        # Increase cache size to 64MB
        # WHAT: This sets the size of SQLite's in-memory page cache. The negative value (-64000) specifies
        #       the size in kilobytes, so this allocates 64MB of memory to caching database pages.
        # WHY: A larger cache reduces the need to repeatedly read database pages from disk, improving
        #      performance for read-heavy operations. Itâ€™s especially useful for apps with frequent queries.
        await self.connection.execute("PRAGMA cache_size = -64000;")

        # Store temporary tables and results in memory
        # WHAT: Temporary tables, indices, and other intermediate results are stored in memory instead of disk.
        # WHY: Using RAM for temporary storage speeds up operations like sorting and joins, which can be common
        #      in complex queries or when working with intermediate data during bulk inserts/updates.
